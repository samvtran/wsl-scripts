# WSL Scripts
A collection of useful scripts I use for Windows Subsystem for Linux.

You might find them useful too :)

## Installation

You might find one of the following installation methods useful for your WSL environment:

- Clone this repo and use your shell's alias functionality to alias a useful command
    - e.g., `alias code=/path/to/vscode.sh` so you can run `code style.css`.
- Symlink scripts from this repo into your local or global bin directory
- Copy scripts you want into your local or global bin directory
